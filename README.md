# Experimental evolution in *S. *pombe
DNA and RNA-sequencing of 10 populations of the fission yeast evolved for 10,000 generations in the same conditions as a pre-existing budding yeast dataset, i.e. high-sugar media and hypoxic conditions, allowing us to observe repeatable evolutionary outcomes within species but diverse molecular mechanisms and targets of adaptation across species.
